# dating

date calculation tool

**dating** is a computational tool for date-related data.

## features

> [!NOTE]
> this project is a work in progress

- easy to use command line interface
- change the present date to aid with your calculations

## how to use

i am tired of explaining this.

## how this works

this is a simple CLI-based date calculator. you can change the current date to help out with the computation.

## to-do

- [x] figure out the objective and scope
- [x] basic cobol config
- [x] setup for date handling
- [x] CLI handler
- [x] set a date as present (default: current date)
- [ ] calculate the date for # days in the future and past
- [ ] calculate the # days after/before the present day

## extras

previously, i started [doos](https://github.com/theluqmn/doos) - a to-do list manager, to learn how to work with dates. after a while, i realise that its somewhat too complex for the sole objective, hence i moved to this project instead. i intended this to be a simple, one-night thing (i did the calculation things)
